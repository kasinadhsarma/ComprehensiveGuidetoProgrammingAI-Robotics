# Chapter 2: Introduction to Python, C, JavaScript, and Java: From Basics to In-Depth

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore four of the most influential and widely-used programming languages: Python, C, JavaScript, and Java. These languages were chosen for their significance in various domains of computer science, including AI, robotics, web development, and system programming. Each language has its unique strengths and is particularly well-suited for specific types of problems and applications.

## Overview of Programming Paradigms

Before diving into specific programming languages, it's essential to understand the fundamental programming paradigms that shape how we approach problem-solving in software development. The main paradigms we'll encounter in this chapter are:

1. Imperative Programming
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
3. Functional Programming
4. Procedural Programming

Each paradigm has its strengths and is suited for different types of problems. The languages we'll explore in this chapter - Python, C, JavaScript, and Java - support one or more of these paradigms, contributing to their versatility and widespread adoption in the industry.

## Python

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming.

### Syntax and Basic Structure

Python uses indentation to define code blocks, making it visually clean and easy to read.

```python
# This is a comment
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

### Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

1. Numeric Types: `int`, `float`, `complex`
2. Sequence Types: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
3. Text Type: `str`
4. Mapping Type: `dict`
5. Set Types: `set`, `frozenset`
6. Boolean Type: `bool`

Example:

```python
# Numeric types
x = 5       # int
y = 3.14    # float

# Sequence types
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# String
message = "Hello, Python!"

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Boolean
is_python_fun = True
```

### Control Structures

Python supports standard control structures like if-else statements, loops, and exception handling.

```python
# If-else statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Exception handling
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

### Functions

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

### Object-Oriented Programming

Python supports OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says Meow!
```

Python's simplicity and extensive standard library make it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Its applications range from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing.

### Package Management and Virtual Environments

Python's package management system, pip, allows easy installation and management of third-party libraries. Virtual environments enable isolated development environments for different projects:

```python
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows

# Install a package
pip install numpy

# List installed packages
pip list

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

This system greatly facilitates dependency management and project isolation. Virtual environments are crucial for maintaining consistent development environments across different projects and team members. They help avoid conflicts between package versions and ensure reproducibility of your Python projects.

## C

C is a powerful, low-level programming language that provides fine-grained control over hardware resources. It follows the procedural programming paradigm and is known for its efficiency and portability.

### Syntax and Basic Structure

C programs typically consist of functions, with the `main()` function serving as the entry point:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Data Types

C provides several basic data types:

1. Integer types: `int`, `short`, `long`, `long long`
2. Floating-point types: `float`, `double`, `long double`
3. Character type: `char`

Example:

```c
int age = 30;
float pi = 3.14159f;
char grade = 'A';
```

### Control Structures

C supports standard control structures:

```c
// If-else statement
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    printf("x is greater than 5\n");
} else {
    printf("x is not greater than 5\n");
}

// For loop
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
}

// While loop
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    printf("%d ", count);
    count++;
}
```

### Functions

Functions in C are defined with a return type, name, and parameters:

```c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    printf("Factorial of 5: %d\n", factorial(5));
    return 0;
}
```

### Memory Management

C provides direct memory management through pointers:

```c
int x = 5;
int *ptr = &x;  // ptr holds the memory address of x
printf("Value of x: %d\n", *ptr);  // Dereferencing ptr
```

### Structures

Structures allow grouping of related data:

```c
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

int main() {
    struct Person p1 = {"Alice", 30};
    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", p1.name, p1.age);
    return 0;
}
```

C's low-level capabilities make it ideal for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for web development. It supports multiple paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming.

### Syntax and Basic Structure

JavaScript can be embedded in HTML or run as a standalone script:

```javascript
// This is a comment
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

### Data Types

JavaScript has several data types:

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Object
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol (ES6)

Example:

```javascript
let age = 30;
let name = "Alice";
let isStudent = false;
let person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"};
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

### Control Structures

JavaScript supports standard control structures:

```javascript
// If-else statement
let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    console.log("x is not greater than 5");
}

// For loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

// While loop
let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    console.log(count);
    count++;
}
```

### Functions

Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens:

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
```

### Object-Oriented Programming

JavaScript uses prototype-based OOP:

```javascript
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
dog.speak();  // Output: Buddy barks.
```

### Asynchronous Programming

JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, and async/await:

```javascript
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched"), 2000);
    });
}

async function getData() {
    try {
        const result = await fetchData();
        console.log(result);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

getData();
```

JavaScript's versatility makes it essential for web development, both on the client-side and server-side (Node.js).

## Java

Java is a popular, general-purpose programming language designed to be platform-independent. It follows the "write once, run anywhere" principle and is strongly object-oriented.

### Syntax and Basic Structure

Java programs are organized into classes:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Data Types

Java has two categories of data types:

1. Primitive types: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`
2. Reference types: Classes, Interfaces, Arrays

Example:

```java
int age = 30;
double pi = 3.14159;
boolean isStudent = false;
String name = "Alice";
```

### Control Structures

Java supports standard control structures:

```java
// If-else statement
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is not greater than 5");
}

// For loop
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

// While loop
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    System.out.println(count);
    count++;
}
```

### Object-Oriented Programming

Java is built around OOP principles:

```java
class Animal {
    private String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void speak() {
        System.out.println(name + " makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println(name + " barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        dog.speak();  // Output: Buddy barks.
    }
}
```

### Exception Handling

Java provides robust exception handling:

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This always executes.");
}
```

### Interfaces and Polymorphism

Java uses interfaces to achieve multiple inheritance and polymorphism:

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bird is flying.");
    }
}

class Airplane implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Airplane is flying.");
    }
}
```

Java's robustness, security features, and extensive ecosystem make it popular for enterprise applications, Android development, and large-scale systems.
