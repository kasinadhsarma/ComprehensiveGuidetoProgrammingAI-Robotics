        super(SimpleRNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        _, hidden = self.rnn(x)
        output = self.fc(hidden.squeeze(0))
        return output

# Initialize the model
model = SimpleRNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=2)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the model with your data
# for epoch in range(num_epochs):
#     outputs = model(inputs)
#     loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
#     optimizer.zero_grad()
#     loss.backward()
#     optimizer.step()
